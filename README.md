Hook n' crook
Several searches for the article (linear search, bruteforce, binary search, interpolation search, and several hunting based searches (and hunting itself ofc).
The task was to count all the keys in the article by frequency of occurrence. It was forbidden to use the built-in hash function, ord, and so on. I've got interpolation and binary as main ones, but I've decided to expand my work. Actually, I didn't have a complete hunting (or tracking idk) search algorithm, so I modified it according to my thoughts. That's all i guess.
P.S. because of the job requirements, interpolation search sucks, just accept it and chill
P.S.S the article itself and my py dict are in russian, just accept it and chill X2
